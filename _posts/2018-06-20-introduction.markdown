Hey all, Kurt here! I'm not updating this blog all too often, but it will be updated with pictures and info at least twice a month.

So, as a fair introductory post, I'll be explaining the way hurricanes are labeled and why.

First of all, hurricanes are just a form of tropical cyclones that happen in the Atlantic and north-eastern Pacific hurricane basins. In other parts of the world, they are called cyclones, typhoons, or cyclonic storms.
